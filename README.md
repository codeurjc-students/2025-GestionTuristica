# +HOTEL

## Summary

This hotel booking application is designed to be a functional app that can be used by both clients and agencies to
book and manage hotel reservations.

This application provides the tools for clients to search for hotels, reserve rooms, modify the reservation, cancel it
and rate the hotels where they stayed. And also the necessary tools for a travel agency to manage the ones made by the
clients.

Only technical and functional objectives have been defined so far. Implementation has not been started yet.
