# +HOTEL

## Summary

This hotel booking application is designed to be a functional app that can be used by both clients and agencies to 
book and manage hotel reservations.

This application provides the tools for clients to search for hotels, reserve rooms, modify the reservation, cancel it 
and rate the hotels where they stayed. And also the necessary tools for a travel agency to manage the ones made by the clients.

Only technical and functional objectives have been defined so far. Implementation has not been started yet.

## Project Objectives

### Functional Objectives

- Provide the tools to make, modify and cancel room reservations
- Allow users to search and filter hotels
- Allow admins to manage reservations and hotels from an exclusive admin page
- Manage user authentication, with user roles that control which pages can be accessed and allow users to check and 
manage their own reservations
- Allow users to review the hotels where they stayed
- Provide tools to download your reservation bill and notify users if their reservations were cancelled or modified by 
an admin

### Technical Objectives

- Develop frontend using Angular with TypeScript
- Develop backend in Java using Spring Boot, structured into controllers, services and middleware, adding security with
Spring Security
- Use MySQL as database service
- Connect frontend and backend through API REST
- Document the API REST services with Spring doc and Swagger

## System Functionalities

Functionalities have been sorted into three categories: 
- Basic: Basic functionalities that are not very complex and fundamental for the application.
- Intermediate: Functionalities with a little more complexity, less vital to the app, but still necessary for the main
  services provided by the application.
- Advanced: The most complex functionalities of the app.
